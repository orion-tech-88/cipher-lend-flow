# Security Configuration Guide

This document provides guidelines for securely configuring the CipherLend application.

## üîê Environment Variables Security

### Required Environment Variables

Before deploying or running the application, you must configure the following environment variables:

#### Frontend Configuration
```env
# Chain Configuration
VITE_CHAIN_ID=11155111
VITE_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID

# Wallet Connect Configuration
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID

# FHE Configuration
VITE_FHE_NETWORK_URL=https://devnet.zama.ai
VITE_FHE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

#### Backend/Deployment Configuration
```env
# Contract Deployment
RISK_ASSESSOR_ADDRESS=YOUR_RISK_ASSESSOR_ADDRESS
VERIFIER_ADDRESS=YOUR_VERIFIER_ADDRESS
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### 1. API Key Management

- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for development and production

### 2. Private Key Security

- **Never expose private keys in code or configuration files**
- Use hardware wallets for production deployments
- Consider using multi-signature wallets for contract deployment
- Store private keys in secure key management systems

### 3. Environment Variable Security

- Use `.env.local` for local development (not committed to git)
- Use platform-specific environment variable management for production
- Regularly audit environment variable access
- Use least-privilege access for API keys

### 4. Contract Address Security

- Verify contract addresses before deployment
- Use deterministic deployment for reproducible builds
- Document all contract addresses and their purposes
- Monitor contract interactions for suspicious activity

## üîß Configuration Setup

### Local Development

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

2. Fill in your actual values in `.env.local`:
```env
VITE_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your-actual-project-id
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id
# ... other variables
```

3. Never commit `.env.local` to version control

### Production Deployment

1. Set environment variables in your deployment platform (Vercel, etc.)
2. Use secure key management for sensitive values
3. Enable environment variable encryption if available
4. Regularly rotate production keys

## üö® Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All API keys are properly configured
- [ ] Private keys are stored securely
- [ ] Environment variables are not exposed in client-side code
- [ ] Contract addresses are verified
- [ ] FHE network configuration is correct
- [ ] Wallet Connect project ID is valid
- [ ] RPC endpoints are accessible
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Regular Security Tasks

1. **Audit Environment Variables**
   - Review all environment variables monthly
   - Remove unused variables
   - Update expired keys

2. **Monitor API Usage**
   - Check API key usage patterns
   - Monitor for unusual activity
   - Set up alerts for high usage

3. **Contract Security**
   - Monitor contract interactions
   - Review transaction logs
   - Check for suspicious activity

4. **Access Control**
   - Review team access to sensitive configuration
   - Remove access for team members who no longer need it
   - Use role-based access control

## üÜò Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Rotate all API keys immediately
   - Revoke compromised access tokens
   - Check transaction logs for unauthorized activity

2. **Investigation**
   - Review access logs
   - Check for unauthorized deployments
   - Analyze any suspicious transactions

3. **Recovery**
   - Deploy from a known good state
   - Update all security configurations
   - Notify affected users if necessary

## üìû Security Contacts

For security-related issues:

- **General Security**: security@cipherlend.com
- **Critical Issues**: Use GitHub security advisories
- **Bug Reports**: Create a private security issue on GitHub
